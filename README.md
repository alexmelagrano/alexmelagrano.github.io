Personal Website

Website serves as my portfolio and supplements my resume. Will house webapp variants of school 
projects that can be used by anyone visiting the website, contact information and links to my 
Github and linkedin, a link to my resume itself, and other important information.

Programmed in HTML/CSS, and will likely incorporate Javascript/JQuery/something to add animated 
features to the website in the future. Edited using Adobe's Brackets, managed through Github and 
SourceTree.
